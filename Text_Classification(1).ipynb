The facts supported\\nBoomer\\'s contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his\\nproperty, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop\\ndoing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider\\nsuch issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to\\ndo or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage\\nfaced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case\\nbefore the court.\\n\\n> Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation\\n> requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because\\n> of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1,\\n> you\\'d be up in arms.

Quite the contrary, I\\'d\\nprobably support the action, since it would be based on the same general\\ndoctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in\\n_Boomer_: the idea that people\\'s property rights should not be violated\\nfor reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer\\'s\\nproperty rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the\\nhypothetical EPA ruling you\\'ve presented, it\\'s the American people\\'s\\ncollective property rights in a healthy physical environment.

Which \"one\" are you\\nspeaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people\\'s rights.\\nBesides, Coase\\'s Theorem only has real application in the never-never\\nland of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people\\nare going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise \"irrational\"\\nfrom a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to\\nprotect their right to be so.  I don\\'t care if you can show me logically\\nthat your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,\\nso I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150\\nper head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don\\'t\\nwant any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.\\n\\n*   *   *   *   *\\n\\n>> And then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\n>> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were\\n>> avoided.\"  As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were\\n>> \"made whole.\"  They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their\\n>> rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that\\n>> property at a price acceptable to them.

We don\\'t\\n> require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation;\\n> why in tort?\\n\\nLast question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because\\nto do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth\\nAmendment.\\n\\nAs to your \"Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made\\nwhole, because the award of damages in involuntary\" claim, you\\'re at\\nleast partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has\\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\\nprefer).  In these cases, the \"sale\" has already taken place and is\\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\\n\\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\\npotential victim\\'s property rights are protected until and unless he\\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\\nparties themselves.\\n\\n>> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\n>> business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n>> (If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\n>> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n>\\n> Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.\\n\\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they\\'re simply a cost of doing business.  The\\nfact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into\\na position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a\\nresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant\\nwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose\\nproperty rights they\\'d be violating via the operation of their plant.\\nThere\\'s nothing punitive or unjust about it.\\n\\n>> (2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\n>> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\n>> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\n>> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\n>> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\n>> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n>> [wdstarr]\\n>\\n> Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire\\n> set of possessions to wronged person?

This was appraently attempted in the\\ncase of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason\\nto believe it still goes on.\\n\\nRead this:\\n\\nFrom Ma\\'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992\\n\\nPUBLICATION BAN\\n\\n        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many\\n        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were\\n        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of\\n        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever\\n        being made public.\\n\\nBy Baruch Me\\'iri\\n\\nAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way\\nor another: \"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I\\nwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific\\ncase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something\\nwhich may legally not be published\".\\n\\nThe State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years\\nthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to\\nlong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the\\ncrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More\\nprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of\\ntheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.\\n\\nIn Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of\\nthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about\\nthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,\\nfor security offenses, in complete secrecy.\\n\\nIn the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]\\naffair -- we heard about \"the third man\" being in prison.  But many\\nyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today no\\nlonger be found even in South American countries, or in the former\\nCommunist countries.\\n\\nBut it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.\\n\\nThe Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and\\nJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this\\nweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet\\nLegal Advisor.  Ma\\'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:\\n\\n\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\\nimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\\nthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\\nspecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but\\neven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after\\nbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison\\nwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the\\nprisoner\", asserts MK Zucker.\\n\\nOn the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is\\nabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\\nimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\\nsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\\nthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\\nunder which a trial will not be held in public.\\n\\n\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\\nthe mere fact of a person\\'s arrest, and on the name of a person\\nsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\\nIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\\nknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\\nsight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\"\\n\\nZucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\\nJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider\\nthe question.  \"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the\\ncost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The\\nState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention\\nand its cause is kept secret\", wrote Zucker.\\n\\nThe legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\\nShiffman said that, \"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any\\ncases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\\nand whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\\nwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like\\ncensorship is an unhealthy matter\".\\n\\n\"The Union is aware\", says Shiffman, \"of cases where notification of a\\nsuspect\\'s arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\\nspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\\nwas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\\nfirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.\\n\\n\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --\\ncan challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where\\nthe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The\\njournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is\\nhappy...\"\\n\\nAttorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\\nlaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\\nperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \\n\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that\\'s\\nthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\\nyears in prison without us knowing anything about it.\"\\n\\n-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\\nsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\\npublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\\ntotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\\nMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\\nwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\\ntrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\\nthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\\nthough not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\\nare aware of his imprisonment.\"\\n\\n-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can\\'t we trust the\\ndiscretion of the court?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"The judges have no choice but to trust the\\npresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\\ninvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\\nthey can misuse.\"\\n\\n-- And what if there really is a security issue?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\\n Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\\nto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\\nentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\\npublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\\nmurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\\nmatter being made public.\"\\n\\nAttorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\\nbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect\\'s\\narrest, or of a convicted criminal\\'s imprisonment.  \"A healthy\\nsituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\\npublication may be harmful to state security\".\\n\\nA different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\\nadvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\\nMeir.  \"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\\nsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\\nbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\\nof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\\nwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless\", adds Shtendal, \"the legislator allowed for the\\npossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\\ndamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\\nwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I\\'ve mentioned.\\nThe authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\\nthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\\nwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\\nbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \"As a rule, clearly such a\\nphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in\\nthe most extreme circumstances.\"\\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n'),\n",

He was asked specifically about the issue\\nof homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next\\nmonth.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range\\nthe gamut from \"outlawing\" homosexuality altogether to \"legalizing\" it\\ncompletely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult\\nissue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church\\nsplit in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without\\nquestion, the issue may split the church again after we\\'ve been reunited\\nfor all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is\\npushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion\\nissue last year as a solution.\\n\\nHe is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the\\nmembers of the church \"Agree to Disagree\" on the issue, admitting that\\nboth sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead\\nthem to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion\\nissue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that\\nthe GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree\\nwith their own view.\\n\\n--\\nCliff Slaughterbeck           | \\nDept. of Physics, FM-15       |   It\\'s time for the sermon on the\\nUniversity of Washington      |   Grand Torino!\\nSeattle, WA 98195             |\\n\\n[It\\'s going to be hard to agree to disagree.

I\\'ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the \\nfuture.  When I do, I\\'ll make sure you get copies.  \\n\\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \\nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \\n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \\nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \\nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I\\'ll \\nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \\nwith your note.  \\n\\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn\\'t \\nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \\ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \\n\\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn\\'t \\nsupport the gun prohibitionists\\' original numerical contentions \\nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \\nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \\n\\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \\ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \\nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \\npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \\n\\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \\n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \\nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \\ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \\nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \\non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \\nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \\nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \\nclearly indicate the contrary.  \\n\\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \\nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \\nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \\nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \\n\\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \\nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \\nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \\nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \\ncriminal offense.  \\n\\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \\nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \\nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \\nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \\nwouldn\\'t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \\nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \\nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody\\'s \\npermission. In this I\\'m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \\nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \\npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \\nBefore the \\'68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \\nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \\nineffective toys.  There probably weren\\'t six million of them in \\nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \\nand their ilk -- AMERICA\\'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \\nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\\n\\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \\naware of this -- so I guess you\\'ll have to ask them yourself what \\ntheir real motives are.  \\n\\nLook:  gun-making isn\\'t an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \\nit\\'s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \\nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \\nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \\nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \\nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \\nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \\nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\\n\\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \\nprovides or any court decides, I\\'m always going to be armed.  And I \\nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \\nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \\n-- where I come from.  We can\\'t be stopped by passing laws, we can \\nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \\nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \\nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \\n\\nSo what\\'s the point?  \\n\\nL.

Not any more!  Many\\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \\nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\\nuseful payload to orbit.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\"),\n",

Cecil King\\'s nominating statement (as it appeared in the\\nOwners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by\\nthe by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:\\n\\n\"Each candidate\\'s biography and position statement shall be limited to\\na combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.\\n\\n    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil\\'s\\nstatement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with\\nthe word \"undertiding\" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement\\nof his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a\\ngrossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does\\nnot just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the \\nprocess.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps\\nyou intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.\\n     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would\\nbe most appreciative that when tou call me an \"asshole\" you remind the\\nletter\\'s recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost\\nguaranteed to have woeful consequences.\\n   With kind regards, I remain,\\n                                 Robert Higdon\\n\\nO.K.

(Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)\\n(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was\\nprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)\\n\\tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo\\npopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population is\\nruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you\\nhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism\\nof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start\\nto see for example the Andromeda\\'s bursters.\\n\\tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution\\n(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with\\nthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence\\nisotropy) and the edge is \"the edge of the Universe\" ;-)\\nIf at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)\\nand a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star\\ncolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting\\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\\n\\n\\tIf we know anything about physics at that level,\\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\\n\\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\\nthey\\'d actually probably fit relatively easily into the\\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\\n\\n   my own pet theory is that it\\'s  Flying saucers  entering\\n   hyperspace :-)\\n\\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\\n\\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...\\n\\n*  Steinn Sigurdsson   \\t\\t\\tLick Observatory      \\t*\\n*  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu\\t\\t\"standard disclaimer\"  \\t*\\n*  The laws of gravity are very,very strict\\t\\t\\t*\\n*  And you\\'re just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*\\n'),\n",

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \\nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \\n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \\nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \\nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \\nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease. By \\nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease). \\n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \\nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \\nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \\ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans.

It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

The remainder -- five out of six --\\nobtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving\\nfriends and associates, family members, and various black market\\noutlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources\\nincluded cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and\\noften theft.

Kopel\\n\\n     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,\\nTobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.\\nThe study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous\\ncriminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable\\nimpact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns\\nare purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.\\n\\n51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal\\nEnforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of\\n20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;\\nof those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who\\ncommitted crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)\\n(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony\\nconvictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\\nFirearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to\\nDirector, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony\\nrecords who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or\\nnon-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).\\n\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nINDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91\\n\\n                          THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC:\\n                      POLITICAL CORRECTNESS\" TAKES AIM\\n                            AT THE CONSTITUTION\\n\\n                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel\\n\\n     Testimony before Congress revealed that most \"assault weapons\" in the\\nhands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony\\nis consistent with the National Institute of Justice\\'s research findings\\nbased on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by\\nsociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent\\nof criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The\\nfigures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the\\ncriminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents\\nof gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and\\nprobably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of\\nguns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime\\ndirectly target the black market in criminal guns, and\\nleave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright\\nbelieves that the consequences of current \"assault weapon\" legislation on\\nstreet violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun\\ncontrols aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of\\ncriminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new\\nbusiness.{100}\\n\\n6.   _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

What are your thoughts on it?  \\n\\nI read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name\\non the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really\\noffensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or\\npublisher), and read it, \"cover to cover\" (to use a phrase that seems\\npopular here right now).\\n\\nAnd I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but\\nit was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie\\ngrew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in\\nNew Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the\\nstrange constructions of Indian English: the \"yaar\" at the end of a\\nsentence, \"Butbutbut,\" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)\\n\\nAt the time I still \"sorta-kinda\" thought of myself as a muslim, and I\\ncouldn\\'t see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this\\nwas allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who\\ntook on the names and personae of Muhammed\\'s wives, and had not (as my\\ngrandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed\\'s wives were prostitutes; in\\nshort, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to\\nhave missed the point completely.  (And I won\\'t mention the fact that the\\nmost militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)\\n\\nPerhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it\\nexposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity\\nneed an agent? She can come directly to me, can\\'t she? How do we know that\\nMuhammed didn\\'t just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how\\ndo we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn\\'t screw up, or\\nput in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four\\nwomen, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest\\ninsult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to\\nsuppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some \"holy\" guy. Not to\\nmention murder the author.)\\n\\n>Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim\\n>posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book\\n>and had called it such things as \"filth and lies\", \"I would rank\\n>Rushdie\\'s book with Hitler\\'s Mein Kempf or worse\", and so on.\\n\\nI had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really\\nsilly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read \"Mein\\nKampf?\" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don\\'t they\\njust read the book and decide for themselves?\\n\\nMaybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of\\nprotest from the \"liberal\" muslims to Khomeini\\'s fatwa outrage, was the\\nfinal push I needed into atheism!\\n\\n-s\\n--\\n  Shamim Mohamed / {uunet,noao,cmcl2..}!arizona!shamim / shamim@cs.arizona.edu\\n  \"Take this cross and garlic; here\\'s a Mezuzah if he\\'s Jewish; a page of the\\n    Koran if he\\'s a Muslim; and if he\\'s a Zen Buddhist, you\\'re on your own.\"\\n   Member of the League for Programming Freedom - write to lpf@uunet.uu.net\\n'),\n",

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline \\nsearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since \\ncommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or \\nbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.\\nThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are \\nrecommended rather than yogurt.\\n\\nI guess the next question is why would this introduction of \"good\" bacteria \\nback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the \\nanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy\\ndenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \\nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \\ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \\nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \\nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \\nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \\nlooses it\\'s major food source.\\n\\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \\nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \\nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \\nbeen used to get this effect but I\\'ve not seen any such treatment reported in \\nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \\ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \\npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \\never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \\nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \\nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \\nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\\n\\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \\ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But \\nthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty \\nhot and somebody could get burned.  It\\'s really tough.  Do I follow only \\nwell established protocols and then give up if they don\\'t work that well or \\ndo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn\\'t been proven to \\nwork yet?\\n\\nMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they \\ninvolve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into \\nthe gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other \\nis getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a \\nproblem with recurring yeast infections.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n'),\n",

Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare.\"\\n\\n    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting\\n on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty\\n agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up\\n with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to\\n search for a \"Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial\\n number.\"  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also\\n authorized agents to seize \"any tools used in the alteration or\\n modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers,\\n books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants\\n or owners of the property to be searched....\"\\n\\n    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force\\n operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital\\n involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against\\n Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons\\n drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the\\n front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw\\n personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the\\n floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins;\\n stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table\\n in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not\\n latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.\\n\\n    \"My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted\\n through and couldn\\'t latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and\\n stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,\\n the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my\\n magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking\\n around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to\\n turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down.\\n Then I found the note.  \"Nothing Found - ATF.\"\\n\\n    \"They didn\\'t make any attempt to notify me.  I\\'ve lived in Tulsa\\n all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they\\n can\\'t look that up, realize I\\'ve been law-abiding my whole life, then\\n come to the door when I\\'m home?  They didn\\'t leave someone here to\\n watch over my private property.  They didn\\'t even come by to explain\\n what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide\\n open and left.\"\\n\\n    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  \"I asked,\\n \\'Are you gonna\\' arrest me?\\' and he said, \\'No.\\'  I asken him, \"Who is\\n going to repair and clean up my house?\\'  And he said, \"If you\\'re going\\n to talk to me, come down to my office.\\'\\n\\n    \"\\'I can\\'t come down!\\' I said.  \\'My doors are broken!\\'  If I had\\n been on vacation and I didn\\'t have friendly neighbors, I would have\\n lost everything I own.

Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n\\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\\n\\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\\n\\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\\n\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n\\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\\n  to the mid-60's.\\n\\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\\n\\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\\n\\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\\n  networks.\\n\\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\\n\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n\\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\\n  classified.\\n\\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\\n\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n\\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\\n\\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\\n  brute-force search is impractical.\\n    \\n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\\n\\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\\n\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n\\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\\n  probably strong.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\\n    \\n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\\n\\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\\n\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n\\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\\n  doesn't have a chance.\\n\\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\\n  [KAH67].\\n  \\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\\n\\n  Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design\\n  secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst\\n  could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody\\n  to invest the work needed to crack a system.\\n\"),\n",

Is my assumption of\\n>societally based morals wrong?  \\n\\nNo, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get\\nto a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful.\\nThe interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major\\ndefining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, and\\nis the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes me\\nas most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the\\nnet.\\n\\nAn exceptionally good place to get a clear view of \"social norms\" in\\naction is the \"micro\" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some very\\ngood introductory essays (\"Deference and Demeanor\" is a classic), as\\nwell as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult and\\ntheoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But even\\nat his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily\\njargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.\\n\\nMorality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in\\nthe setting of their expectations of other people, and others\\' expectations\\nof them.  This becomes \"systematized\" in a \"socially mandated\" way simply\\nbecause otherwise we\\'d have to invent the entire context of interpersonal\\nrealtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter-\\nactions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego-\\ntiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.\\nWe simply learn it (most of it) early, along with language (which is one\\nof the main exemplars.)\\n--\\nMichael L.

ABout\\na year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        \\nleaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid\\nback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and\\ngot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem\\nlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months\\nlater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure\\nthere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I\\ndidn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch\\nhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I\\nwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the\\nproblem.\\n\\nI should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the\\npedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in\\norder to actuate the clutch.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,\\nthe angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the\\ncylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.\\n\\nWhat do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix\\nshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?\\n\\nNow the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain\\nwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the\\npassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which\\nthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What\\ncan you suggest here?\\n\\nMany thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...\\n\\nBill Christens-Barry\\ncerulean@access.digex.com\\n\\n\"),\n",

I am the administrator\\nof csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out\\nthe needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which \\nincludes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and\\nother places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally\\ndisabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of\\nincident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several\\nmonths ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old\\nstory, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't\\nremember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to\\nfind out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted\\nhere, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have\\nalways been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with \\nClipper.\\n\\nI posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here\\nbecause csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account\\ncalled 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains\\nthe addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory\\nBoard, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses\\nof other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography,\\nsecurity, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on\\nthis list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information\\nfirst-hand.\\n\\nThe 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is \\nnot a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial\\ntraffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get\\ntraffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.\\n\\nWhile you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,\\nI would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives\\nof the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them\\nfor what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common\\npractice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again\\nwas unintentional.\\n\\n-John Wack\\n  \\n\"),\n",

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\\n\\nSAOSHYANT:\\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\\n[See Frashokereti]\\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\\nits roots to the same source.\\n'),\n",

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\\nan \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\\n\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC\\'s are highly\\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\\ntelegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????\\n\\nGET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE\\nTODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!\\n\\nIf it had been up to Edison, we\\'d still be in the 19th century.\\n(flame me at your own peril.

Neil Smith\\n\\n                           WEIRD SCIENCE\\n\\nEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips \\nmove.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are \\npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \\n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \\n\\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \\nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \\nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \\nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \\nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \\n\\nWhat we didn\\'t hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \\nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \\nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \\nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \\nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \\nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \\n\\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \\nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen\\'s weren\\'t \\nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \\n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you\\'d never \\nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn\\'t fit \\ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \\nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \\n\\nBut for once, the media aren\\'t entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \\nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \\nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today\\'s \"scientists\" \\nhave agendas of their own.  \\n\\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \\ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \\nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \\nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \\nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \\ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \\n\\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \\nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \\nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \\nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \\nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \\n\\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \\n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \\ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \\na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \\nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \\ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \\n\\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \\nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \\npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \\nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \\nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \\nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \\n\\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \\nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \\nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \\nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \\nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \\n\\nAnd what the media didn\\'t say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \\neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \\nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \\nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It\\'s enough to make you wonder whether \\nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \\n\\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \\ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \\nto know the hazards.  I\\'ve never believed smoking to be a healthy \\npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today\\'s \\nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \\nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \\nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \\nisn\\'t any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \\ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \\n\\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \\nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \\ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \\nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \\ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \\nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \\n-- has wound up being shed.  \\n\\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people\\'s \\nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \\nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \\nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \\nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \\nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \\n\\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \\nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \\nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \\nreal science won\\'t languish for lack of funding.  The money will \\nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \\neveryone will benefit.  \\n\\nL.

There are non-surgical ways,\\nhowever, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their\\nostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker\\'s book talks about this.\\nThe underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of\\nsinus surgery, though.\\n\\nAbout asthma, that\\'s a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,\\n\"Sinus Survival\", *speculates* (and says it\\'s not proven), that many cases\\nof asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage\\n(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.

Unfortunately,\\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn\\'t allow AnyModifier to be combined\\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\\n\\n>In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says \"For information\\n>on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...\", this is so you\\n>know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

If\\nyou\\'re a Motif implementor, I\\'d suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user\\'s\\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\\ntranslations.\\n\\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\\n\\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it\\'s not possible.  That\\'s according to\\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\\n\\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\\n>can\\'t use XtInstallAccelerators().\\n\\nI can\\'t think of a reason why not.\\n\\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\\n>case?

To shorten development time, I\\nused TeleUSE\\'s TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\\ndescribed above should work.\\n\\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)\\n'),\n",

Basically, you look into a room that looks\\nsimilar to the following:\\n\\n                             xxxx\\n                         xxxxx   xxxx\\n                     xxxx    x       xxxx\\n                 xxxx        x           xxxx\\n             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx\\n             x           xxxx    xxxx           x\\n             x       xxxx            xxxx       x\\n             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x\\n             xxxx              3 /|\\\\         xxxx\\n                 xxxx            /~\\\\     xxxx\\n                     xxxx            xxxx\\n                         xxxx    xxxx\\n                             xxxx\\n\\nThe good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move\\naround in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]\\n\\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\\'s rising edge has a slope\\nof 1/4. (I\\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).\\n\\nI\\'ve run into two problems; I\\'m sure that other readers have tried this\\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\\n\\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I\\'m\\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\\n\\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\\nshape?\\n\\nCurrently I take:\\n\\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\\n\\nand produce:\\n            \\n             1  2  3  4\\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\\n                                    61 62 63 64\\n\\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\\nit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?\\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\\nalready skewed?\\n\\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\\n\\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\\'t have to\\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I\\'ve decided that this\\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\\na real perspective drawing.\\n\\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help.\\n\\n-- \\nTill next time,                \\\\o/   \\\\o/\\n                                V \\\\o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu\\n<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 V\\n\\n'),\n",

The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an\\nFPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will\\nrequire a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.\\nUsers will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the\\nCyclone's.\\n\\nFor more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.\\n\"),\n",

The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim\\nin the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.\\n\\n> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\\n> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\\n> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\\n> \\n\\nI would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun-\\nications than this lot.\\n\\n> For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\\n> private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\\n> tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\\n> protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n> the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n> law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n> industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n> \\n> Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n> protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n> protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n\\nNormmaly DES.\\n\\n> technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n> by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nNote the use of the word \"business\" in the above. The whole tenor of this\\nrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use\\nis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife\\'s\\near to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.\\nNote that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only\\nreference is to information already in the hands of others. The \\'unauthorized\\nrelease\\' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who\\nhave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.\\nThese people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the\\nkeys.\\n\\nThe criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens\\nto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several\\nof them would be a better idea than CLipper!\\n\\nThem again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded\\nover the last decade ofr so.\\n\\n> A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n> been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNSA\\n\\n> new approach to encryption technology.\\n\\nYeah, this bit is VERY true.\\n\\n>....It can be used in new,\\n> relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n> an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n> using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n> commercial use today.\\n> \\n\\nNote the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo\\nof the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment\\nI suspect. Note also the \\'many\\'. not \\'all\\', as the general tone implies.\\n\\n> This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^\\n> information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n> electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n> ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n> intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nThe case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening\\nof the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by\\nthe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law\\nenforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms\\nis blurred yet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n> \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n> Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n> \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n> Americans.\\n\\nLets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated\\npurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the\\nword \"ensure\". As to \\'protect\\', or \\'law-abiding\\', I will leave to you.\\nSo to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,\\nthe answer in this press release is, YES.\\n\\n> ...Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n> \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n> agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n> device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n> in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n> Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n> government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n> wiretap.\\n\\nJust as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. \\n\\n> The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n> new authorities to access the content of the private\\n> conversations of Americans.\\n\\nJust makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.\\n\\n> To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n> Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n> devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n> government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n> the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n> their findings.\\n\\nWhere do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)\\nAnd as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will\\nbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.\\nAfter all, it is secure, isn\\'t it. The govt will answer that point by its own\\nactions.\\n\\n> The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n> encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n> privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n> criminals and terrorists.

This approach has been endorsed by the\\n>      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n>      officials.\\n\\nQuick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list?\\n\\n> Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?

Product\\n>      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n>      manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nThe reverse engineering provisions of the \\'Mask-work\\' act could be relevent\\nhere.\\n\\n> Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n> \\n> A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n>      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n>      manufacturers.

And this proposal\\nDOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit\\nreference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don\\'t think that the\\nMexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous\\ngesture.\\n\\n> ...  There is a\\n>      false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n>      an \"either-or\" proposition.

The balance is between two repugnant points. The\\nRIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false\\nassessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps\\nYOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined\\nin the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don\\'t agree, you must be a\\ncriminal, as only criminals don\\'t agree with out laws. Also note the non-\\nquestion. \"If what is here was not possible...\"\\n\\n> Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n>      Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n>      that of the Bush Administration?  \\n> \\n> A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n>      technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n>      committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n>      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n>      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n>      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n>      and terrorism.\\n\\nIt indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert\\nsuitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of\\nfreedom and ultra-national sentiment.\\n\\n> Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n>      the government hardware?\\n> \\n> A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n>      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n>      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n>      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n>      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n>      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n>      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n>      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n>      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n>      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n>      of these products.\\n> \\n\\nThis one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the\\nkeys, and the algorithm.

In general, you\\nshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,\\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He\\ndid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the\\nslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he\\nslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a\\nLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I\\nwas very disappointed.\\n\\nYou're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least\\nin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and\\nfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's\\nwhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk about\\nthese issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd\\nhate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like\\nhim very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but\\nintentional) use of the stick.\\n\\nGary\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\\nis only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \\nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \\n>\\n>\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\\n>                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\\n\\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\\n\\n--Rex\\n\\nsuggested, easy reading about epistimology:  \"He is there and He is not Silent\"\\n by Francis Schaeffer.\\n'),\n",

You should\\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \\n complex instead. If you don\\'t (and there are some exceptions to that)\\n you\\'ll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \\n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \\n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\\n\\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \\n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \\n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100\\'s) in one day\\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\\n  \\n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that\\'s why they can\\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\\n\\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \\n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\\n \\n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\\n are big, and they don\\'t taste that great), a product made from pine \\n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\\n The name for the pine bark product is \\'Pycnogenol.\\'\\n  \\n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\\n \\n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \\n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \\n\\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\\n \\n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\\n\\n   -- Ron Roth --\\n =====================================================================\\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\\n\\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.\\n---\\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363\\n'),\n",

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n'),\n",

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\n    for the planet Venus. \\n\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\n\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\n\\n        The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\n    VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\n\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\' \\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\n\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\n    across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.\\n\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\' \\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\n\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\n\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\n\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\n\\n        Venus by Balloon\\n\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of \\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\n\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\n\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\n\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\n\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\n    encounter.\\n\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\n    Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\n    comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\n\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\n\\n        The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\n    location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\n\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\n    successfully arrived. \\n\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\n    permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere. \\n\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\n    had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\n\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\n    journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\n\\n        Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\n    miles) above the surface. \\n\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s \\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\n\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\n    returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\n\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\n    over the last seven years.\\n\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\n\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\n    miles) towards the surface.\\n\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\n    through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer \\n    failed to function.\\n\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\n    Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\n\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\n    hours.\\n\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\n\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\n\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\n    the early 1990s.\\n\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s \\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\n    the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\n\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\n    Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\n\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\n\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\n\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\n\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\n\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\n    make money.  \\n\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\n\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\n\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\n\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\n    probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.\\n\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\n    planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\n\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\n\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\n\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\n    to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\n\\n        Humans on Venus      \\n\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\n    Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\n    to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\n    if not millennia.\\n\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\n\\n        Bibliography -\\n\\n         Barsukov, V.

Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.

As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in\\nimage quality (at least according to the mags -- I can\\'t tell any\\ndifference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one\\nof the two types.  There\\'s VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that\\'s\\nExtremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.\\nBut many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a\\nbunch of mags so it\\'s hard for me to remember which!), which claim \"low\\nemissions\" but not specifically \"MPR-II Compliant\" or \"MPR-II Certified\"\\nonly control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.\\n\\tSo, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-\\ntently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low\\nemissions as the Hitachi.

But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\\n>Gretzky\\'s arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.

They\\'ve had MUCH better teams in their past history than\\n>they currently have, yet they didn\\'t draw as well then.\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it\\'s inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n>This does not make Roger\\'s point any more valid, but the Jets aren\\'t\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn\\'t resist...>\\n\\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\\n>jump in attendance.

To\\nrecapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor\\nmomentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an\\neighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right\\nafter I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that\\nradically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens\\nwith no provocation whatsoever.\\n\\nI have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was\\na man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the\\nproblem was that the 13\" monitor\\'s power supply simply couldn\\'t always\\nkeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from\\na largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor\\'s\\npower supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was\\nreally wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that\\nit had to be endured.)\\n\\nThis seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to\\nadopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13\" monitor\\nowner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the \\nApple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading\\nJitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement\\nof a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,\\nthe swap of a circuit board.\\n\\nI would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had\\nexperience with this sort of thing.\\n\\n'),\n",

First, I recommend the Sony\\nCPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed\\nspecifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video\\ncapabilities which means only the LC\\'s and anything after the ci.  All it\\ntakes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is\\nabout $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of\\ncomparable monitors because they are not multisynch.

It should be clear \\nfrom my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only \\nto the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against the\\nmessiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).\\n\\nThere are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate the\\nmessiah claim, imo.  That\\'s why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It \\nflatly states Jesus \"was the Christ\", and mentions the crucifixion, \\nresurrection and Christian belief in said claims.\\n\\nThe short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James\\' brother - \"... brother of\\nJesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]\", and that\\'s it. \\nIf original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing \\nmore than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.\\n\\nThe long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out of\\ncontext, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistent\\nwith the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as \\ninsert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as in\\nElaine Pagel\\'s _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), \"A comment *attributed* to Josephus\\nreports ....[emphasis mine]\".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that \\nthe long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).\\n\\nThere may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in a\\nlegal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes it\\ndifficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easily\\ndisguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is \\nworthless for the messiah defense, and that\\'s why I didn\\'t mention it. \\n\\nI don\\'t know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,\\nplease let me know.  As for its \"much less gung-ho\" tone, obviously the date \\nof this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu \\nof removal can be easily explained.\\n\\n*<(:-)\\n\\nRich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\\n'),\n",

Ask yourself this.  Why would any private\\nsector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least\\npartially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any\\nprivate sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly\\nevaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)\\nThe answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn\\'t.  There is other hardware out\\nthere not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)\\n\\nMy suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper\\nsystems.  If not we\\'re in trouble.\\n\\nGiven that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we\\'d like\\nto think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.\\nThey know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken\\nseriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know\\nlittle about politics if you don\\'t realize that this is just a first step\\nin the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning\\nor SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \"Clipper\" system is easily\\njustified \"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying\\nto subvert the government?  We\\'ve provided you with a very secure alternative\\nso use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\"\\nHow can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing\\nlaw enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system\\nthe only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can\\'t, and the administration\\nknows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for\\ndrug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.\\n\\nDon\\'t sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can\\'t be THAT stupid.\\nEither banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations\\ncollective I.Q. is about that of a potato.\\n\\nWhy do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?

I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\\n \\nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\\n \\nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\\n \\nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\\n \\nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\\n \\nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\\n \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMost Concerned,\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Signature]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\\nuni@acs.bu.edu\\n\\n-- \\nuni@acs.bu.edu  ->  Public Keys by finger and/or request\\nPublic Key Archives at <pgp-public-keys@junkbox.cc.iastate.edu>\\nDF610670F2467B99  97DE2B5C3749148C  Sovereignty is the sign of a brutal past.\\nCryptography is not a crime.

Some\\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\\n\\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\\n\\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\\nbecause\\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\\nscanning\\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\\nsome machines).\\n\\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\\nonce\\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\\nwant to\\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\\nthe\\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\\nof\\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\\nwant\\nto make stereo sound.\\n\\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\\nthe\\nIBM don\\'t want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\\n\\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\\nhardware,\\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\\nworks.\\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\\n700/900/950\\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\\nonly.\\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\\nspecification,\\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\\n\\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\\n\\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn\\'t really related.\\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\\nmachine\\nyou have.\\n\\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\\n>Lemmings\\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\\n>Glider 4.0\\n>OIDS\\nand also\\nHellcats,\\nSuper Tetris\\nOxyd\\n(and many more, these are just what I\\'ve tested)\\n\\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\\n\\n\\nOther games you list:\\n>Armor Alley\\n>Spectre\\n>Spaceward Ho!\\nand also\\nPGA Tour Golf\\nCivilization\\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\\n\\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\\n\\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON\\'T CHEAT!\\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\\ndo,\\nbut I\\'m going say it anyway.\\nStop cheating on sound!\\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\\nis about to end.\\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\\nwork\\neven better soon, so use it.\\n\\nIn conclusion:\\nTo Doug, it isn\\'t a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\\nTo Jon, it isn\\'t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\\nsound\\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\\nhardware.\\n\\n\\nHave fun.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 1:\\nI don\\'t work on sound here at Apple, I\\'m just pretty well informed.\\nSo don\\'t write me with sound questions.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 2:\\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\\nallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 3:\\nI don\\'t speak for Apple, just me.\\n\\n-Steve Bollinger\\n'),\n",

And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\\n\\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature\\ndoes water boil at?\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\\nif they knew what scale, and was told \"It\\'s just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\\nThat\\'s what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that\\'s sincere, and may be\\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \\nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\\n \\n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\\n\\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \\nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\\n \\n>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \\n>to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\\n>Can you reconcile this?\\n\\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\\nI\\'ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your\\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.  The Bible\\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \\n \\n>> Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.

Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \\nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\\n>\\n>> >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical \\n>> >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding \\n>> >Biblical interpretation.\\n>> \\n>> So?

So I don\\'t need them.  \\nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\\nGod is manifested to God\\'s creation.

First \\nsome background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \\nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \\nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \\nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \\nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \\nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \\nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \\ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \\nsectors a week.\\n \\n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \\nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in \\nabout every 100 files are affected.  \\n \\n        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s \\nsystem, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about \\nsmartdrv to help me out.\\n\\n--                    \\nINTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)\\nUUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver\\nNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115\\n\"),\n",

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I\\'ll give \\nyour question a shot. \\n\\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \\nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \\n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \\npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \\ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\\n\\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \\nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \\nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \\nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \\n\\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I\\'m assuming that the DeskJet can, or \\nHP wouldn\\'t sell many......\\n\\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \\nlike a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\\n\\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200\\'s resolution.  It looks like \\na good laser quality print.  The HP\\'s I\\'ve used.....they look like ink.  Not \\nas impressive.  \\n\\nSo, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?\\n'),\n",

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \\n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \\nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \\nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \\n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \\nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \\nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \\nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \\nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \\nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \\nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however.

(email: fw@world.std.com)\\nMy thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from\\nOracle Corp.\\n\\nThe most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit \\nfeatures or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$\\nincluded suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to \\nuse table views to refine the granularity of access control.\\n\\nOne important security consideration in networked installations\\nis that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user\\nauthentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the \\n_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably \\nnot define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access \\nof OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle \\nservers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv\\noption), while relying on host security for local processes. \\n\\nInternally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) \\naudit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and\\ndata access. These tools can be used to track the primary security\\nrisks from within the Oracle environment.\\n\\nOracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES\\nencryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone\\nto cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate \\nsince the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users \\nchoose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access \\nto your oracle database files through the host operating system, \\ns/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply \\ncryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.\\n\\nAs security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.\\nCertainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,\\ns/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break \\nthe passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without\\nalerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail\\nwhich would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)\\nprovides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not \\nguessable. \\n\\nAs with all computer security, the most important defense is to \\neducate users in the safe choice of passwords.

I was also\\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.

They weren\\'t added later by the Catholic Church; they were\\n\\t\\t*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture.\\n\\t\\t(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason\\n\\t\\tto repeat the info.)\\n\\n\\t2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote\\n\\t\\tthe book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was\\n\\t\\t** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!\\n\\n\\tIf one takes the translation of \"this book\" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere\\n\\taround there) to mean \"all of scripture\", then all of us are likely\\n\\tholding something that is in violation of this command.\\n\\n\\tIt is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones\\n\\t(they didn\\'t like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I\\n\\thad my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe\\n\\tthat several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their\\n\\tmost likely date of composition in the early second century A.D.\\n\\t\\tRevelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of \\n\\tDomition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all\\n\\tin sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was \"added\" to the\\n\\tbook after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add \\n\\tnothing more.\\n\\n\\tIf you want to get the exact dates, get a copy of the New American\\n\\tBible.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \\n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\\nguaranteed to be mapped.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\\nis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \"tickle\" the\\nWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable\\nit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\\n\\nWhat is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?\\n'),\n",

To assist cooling\\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\\nseen rising out of these towers.\\n\\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\\n\\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\\nboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\\nthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\\nby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\\nback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\\n(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\"\\nturbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).\\n\\n                                        R.

Planes from the U.S. have been sending\\n|>aid into Armenian for two years. I would not like to guess about what were in\\n|>the 3 planes in your story, I would like to find out.\\n\\n\\n\\n|>HE]     Search Turkish planes? You don\\'t know what you are talking about.\\n|>HE]     Turkey\\'s government has announced that it\\'s giving weapons\\n|>HE]     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan\\n|>HE]     it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons\\n|>HE]     since it\\'s content is announced to be weapons?\\n\\n\\t|>It\\'s too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia.\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n\\t  That\\'s what i don\\'t want, you couldn\\'t imagine the result of a war.....\\n\\t  So France, Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan???? \\n\\t  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without \\n\\t  saying it, that\\'s no secret any more......\\n\\n\\n\\t  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted.\\n\\t  Do they think that they shall move from it\\'s neigbours when the war\\n \\t  is over???? The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must \\t \\n\\t  live in harmony with these if they don\\'t want a \"stone-age\" country,\\n\\t  for that\\'s what\\'s will happen Armenia if the wars continues.\\n\\t\\n\\t  Look, The President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, died and  Petrosyan\\n\\t  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral. Is it because\\n\\t  he liked him? Sure NOT, because Armenia needs it\\'s neighbours and must\\n\\t  live with these. But Armenia can\\'t stop this war with continued ordertaking\\n\\t  from states like France and USA. With other words, if you love your people\\n\\t  you must think twice.....\\n\\n\\t  And i wonder, \"Shoot down turkish planes\" WITH WHAT????? ohhh i forgot\\n\\t  the Armenians can\\'t find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned\\n\\t  countries.....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHilmi Eren\\nStockholm University\\nSweden\\n\\t  \\n'),\n",

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\\n>world.  \\n\\nThis was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived\\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God\\'s wrath, the other\\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\\nas true.\\n\\n>The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\\n>an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to consign Adam\\n>or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.\\n\\nI don\\'t see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\\nas a completed action.  Rom\\'s makes it clear that it has always been salvation\\nvia faith and nothing else.\\n\\n>It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\\n>relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\\n>extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. \\n\\nI understand what you\\'re trying to convey, but I don\\'t think I\\'d lay hold of it\\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\\nconsciousness.  \\n\\n>It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\\n>were lost. \\n\\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \\nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \\n>\\n>It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\\n>people\\'s ideas of life after death.\\n\\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply\\nhave to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive. \\nEither that or countless trips to the oriental museum.\\n>\\n>Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\\n>time\" a new light entered into the world.

Our new\\n>vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\\n>something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\\n>much more as well.\\n\\n\\nCouldn\\'t agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is\\nclearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring\\nto.\\n\\n>(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\\n>Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\\n>views on this subject).\\n\\n>The way you refer to it as \"doctrine\" puts a modern intellectual coloring\\n>on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\\n>concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\\n>teachings today can be received.\\n\\nNo, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.\\n\\n>\\n>I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\\n>simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\\n>on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\\n>and experience? \\n\\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I\\nthink, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it. \\nLook at Satan\\'s twist of God\\'s Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very\\ninteresting study.\\n\\n >The similarity in the midst of great variety of\\n>expression of the different people\\'s ideas of the time immediately\\n>after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.\\n\\nYes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \"husband son.\")\\n\\n>On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\\n>that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\\n>human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\\n>created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\\n>dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\\n>today.\\n\\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you\\'re alluding to in that the\\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\\nthe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson\\'s \"Egyptians.\"  He really\\ndoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they \"pilfered\" from the\\nEgyptians. \\n\\n> He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\\n>time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\\n>eternal spiritual being had grown dim.\\n\\nI\\'m not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.  Its just that\\n\"there is nothing new under the sun.\"\\n\\n\\n>Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\\n>irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\\n>which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\\n>single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\\n>reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\\n>terms that did not try to spell it out.\\n\\nEach age has its own focus of theology.  The early church struggled with the\\nTrinitarian formulation.  The reformation dealt with authority.  Today,\\neschatology has had much study.  The early creeds do not spell these things out\\nin detail because, 1) they weren\\'t the topic of concern, 2) there was\\ninsufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn\\'t have the exegetical tools that\\nwe have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One\\nage has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is\\ngiven growth.

Those who subscribe to\\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\\nNefertiti was \"a beautiful black queen.\"  This set off an exchange of\\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\\nan article from an Egyptologist titled \"Was Cleopatra Black?\"  (The answer\\nto the title is \"no\"-- she was greek.)\\n\\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary\\nenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark\\nhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and\\ndown the Mediterranean.\\n\\n(Also, if what I remember is correct, the \"Black Madonna\" doesn\\'t represent\\na person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe\\nBuehler....?)\\n\\nIn the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that\\ngreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,\\nthe situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,\\nor various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about\\nthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then\\nthere are the Ethiopians....\\n\\nThose of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these\\npeople are \"white\" (i.e., of the racist\\'s \"race\").  If I may risk a\\npotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the\\nidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering\\nthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval\\nantisemitism on the other, I don\\'t think that this \"Jesus was white\" thesis\\never played the roles that some hold it did.\\n\\nRepresentations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems\\nawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one\\'s own racial group.\\n-- \\nC.

Doing so is cumbersome and\\ntime-consuming.\\n\\nTherefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }\\nfunctions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click\\nof a button, you can change this:\\n\\n    +---------+\\n    + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\nto this:\\n\\n                   +---------+\\n                   + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\n ===============\\n\\nOkay.

Police\\nnow confiscate property, without trial, under a \"good faith probable\\ncause\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug\\ndealers of their ill-gotten gains.

Under\\nthe \"War on Drugs\" campaign of \"zero tolerance\" due process protections\\nhave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have\\nproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians\\nwho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only\\nlegal, but political:  \"My fellow Americans, we must send our young\\npeople the message that we are serious about winning the War On\\nMurder\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun\\nprohibition laws.

Hamas figures\\nsignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel\\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\\nHamas\\'s kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper\\'s Magazine, which\\nobtained and translated the tape.)\\n \\n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I\\'m married and I have\\ntwo daughters.\\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\\nSecurity Services.\\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\\n     We don\\'t execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\\nHe\\'s as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\\nIsraeli soldier.\\n     There\\'s another group of collaborators who perform an even\\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\\ncollaborators. I regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a\\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\\nduty to execute him.\\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\\nuncovering collaborators, We can\\'t afford to abduct an innocent\\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\\ndoubt, then he is executed.\\n     In many cases, we don\\'t have to make our evidence against\\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they\\'re guilty.\\nBut when the public isn\\'t aware that a certain individual is a\\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\\nobtained in the form of a confession.\\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\\ninformation we need.\\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\\nconfess as well.\\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\\nhimself confesses his crimes. \\n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\\nexecution.\\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can\\'t shoot him\\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That\\'s why collaborators\\nare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"What do you\\nthink? How should we execute you?\" One collaborator told us,\\n\"Strangle me.\" He hated the sight of blood.\\n\\n-----\\nNaftaly Stramer \\t\\t\\t | Intergraph Electronics\\nInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    \\nVoice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301\\n\"Quality is everybody\\'s job, and it\\'s everybody\\'s job to watch all that they can.\"\\n'),\n",

In my\\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\\nTheir way is the \\'truth.\\'\\n\\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\\nbut it seems to me a choice.\\n\\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\\n\\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I\\'d ask, \"How do\\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\\nyou\\'re daddy is right?\"  \"He says he\\'s always right!\"\\n\\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\\naren\\'t we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\\nfalse?\\n\\n-------------\\n\\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\\napologize if I\\'m covering tired old ground.  Some of the\\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\\nany comments.\\n\\n| Louis J.

I\\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there\\'s not enough\\nevidence to believe it, or that there\\'s just as good evidence for\\nother religions.  I don\\'t agree, but clearly there are plenty of\\nintelligent people who don\\'t find the evidence convincing.  But that\\ndoesn\\'t seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\\nit are false.\\n\\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that\\'s rather different than\\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\\npeople choose what value to follow, but there\\'s no actual independent\\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it\\'s\\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn\\'t).  The\\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\\nexternal reality.  I hope we\\'re all honest enough not to claim that we\\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don\\'t\\nsee how else we could proceed.\\n\\nThis needn\\'t result in arrogance.  I\\'m certainly interested in talking\\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\\neven if they don\\'t, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it\\'s\\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'),\n",

There are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   Israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\n\\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe Lebanese gov\\'t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\\n\\nNo, the Syrian gov\\'t is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\\nLebanese morass.

IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\\n1604s).\\n\\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would\\nadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As\\nto the comment by the person who said don\\'t bother calling Apple because\\nthey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.\\n    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN\\nCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU\\nTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND\\nTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.\\n\\npersonal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers\\ndoesn\\'t see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to\\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. \"well you can get a resolution\\n1168x832 on this $5,  9\" \"super smelly sock\" monitor that will let you\\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably\\npriced \"oder eater\" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an\\nultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz\\nvertical.\")\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video\\nboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the\\nsides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as\\npossible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an\\ninch.\\n\\n                                                                    -A.\\n'),\n",
